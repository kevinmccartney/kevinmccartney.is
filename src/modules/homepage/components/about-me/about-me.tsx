      Kevin McCartney discovered his love for software engineering by accident
      after picking up some web development work while working on his graphic
      design degree. After teaching himself the ropes, he dropped out of art
      school & hasn’t stopped learning since. Over the last 6 years, Kevin has
      worked with everyone from TechStars startups to major enterprises. Kevin
      currently works with Insight Enterprises as a Principal consultant where
      he does everything from frontend to cloud & beyond. When he’s not slinging
      code, Kevin is playing music, writing, & trying to be a better dad to his
      plants.
